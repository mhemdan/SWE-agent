      <uploaded_files>
      {{working_dir}}
      </uploaded_files>
      I've uploaded a code repository in the directory {{working_dir}}. Consider the following PR description:

      <pr_description>
      {{problem_statement}}
      </pr_description>

      Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?
      I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
      Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the {{working_dir}} directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.
      Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
      1. As a first step, explore the codebase to understand the project structure and technology stack
      2. Read code files relevant to the <pr_description> to understand the current implementation
      3. If applicable, create a test or reproduction script to verify the current behavior
      4. Edit the source code to implement the required changes
      5. Test your changes to confirm they work correctly
      6. Think about edge cases and make sure your implementation handles them well
      7. When you are completely done with all changes and have verified they work, you MUST call the `submit` command to finalize your work
      Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

      IMPORTANT: You MUST call the `submit` command when you have finished making all changes. This is required to save your work and create a pull request.

          Thank you for your work on this issue. Please carefully follow the steps below to help review your changes.

          1. If you made any changes to your code after running tests, please run the tests again.
            If tests are failing, please revisit your changes and make sure they are correct.
            If you have already removed your test scripts, please ignore this step.
          2. Remove any test/reproduction scripts (if you haven't done so already).
          3. If you have modified any TEST files, please revert them to the state they had before you started fixing the issue.
            You can use `git checkout -- /path/to/test/file` to revert files. Use below <diff> to find the files you need to revert.
          4. Run the submit command again to confirm.

          Here is a list of all of your changes:
